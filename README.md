# IHPCSS25_Challenge
Programming Challenge from IHPCSS'25

This repository uses OpenMP to optimize the performance of the PageRank algorithm, measured as iterations/second.
The performance was measured on Dell's Precision 5480

The repository contains two "main" C files, showcasing a solution using CPU and a solution using GPU offload.

Main specs:
CPU: i7-13800H (24 MB cache, 14 cores, 20 threads)
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada
RAM: 32GB


Further improvements may be done as I remember to check the repository.
